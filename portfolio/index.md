Here's a short preview of some of the noteworthy fun things I've done over the years outside of work.

For work stuff, please check out my [résumé](/resume) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikaelgramont).

# Surfing Dirt
A personal project which [I wrote about extensively in a dedicated post](/Releasing-surfing-dirt/).

TLDR; a modern REST/GraphQL/React social network app

# IMA video contest voting results animation

	  A quick little animation I threw together out of a Google Form results list (Google Sheets) and React.

This was for an online video contest where people were asked to vote for 1 of 4 videos.

Dead simple but effective. It tells the story of how the voting went over time. It would have been nice to couple that with information about the contestants' activity on social media to correlate the voting.

The live version is [visible here](https://www.mountainboardworld.org/news/7-the-4-down-project-results). 

# Logo research

Just messing about with canvas, [more details in a dedicated post](/Logo-Generation/).

# Draw me a Kicker
This was a fun one. A PolymerJS and Three.js powered app to generate custom ramp designs for action sports.

# Manikin
A JS/canvas port of a toy I wrote back when I was 16. More info [here](/First-manikin-prototype) and [here](/Manikin-0.1).

# Gangnam Style 2 Billion views celebration
An easter egg we wrote and put on the YouTube video page when Gangnam Style reached 2 billion views.
Ziling and I worked on integrating the code into the page, did the canvas and custom JS, and added character animations provided by Taeho Ko.

# More...
Over the years, I've built tons of stuff, but most of it is sadly not around anymore.
