# Hallo Img.ly, ich bin Mikael!

I'll revert right back to English, as I don't speak German! üò¨

I just ran into your job listings [here](https://imgly.orgos.io/senior-software-engineer-200519) and
[here](https://imgly.orgos.io/senior-frontend-developer-200324), and thought I'd drop you a line through this page.

## So who's this guy?
My name is Mika√´l Gramont, I'm an experienced Web Developer. Lists are easy to scan, so a few things about me:
- been a professional **Web Dev since 2007**.
- I've done a bunch of Back-end but **like the Front-end best**
- spent **a few years in Silicon Valley working for Google**
- currently reside in France
- love the Web platform, and care about **performance, a11y** and **progressive enhancement**  

## Why's he interested in Img.ly?
I've always liked to work with images. When I was a kid, I loved to play with graphics programs (Paint Shop Pro 3!),
3D suites (3D Studio... before it was Max), and games, so I'm naturally drawn to your
[PhotoEditorSDK](https://photoeditorsdk.com) project!

In fact, regardless of the outcome of our conversations, I might try and integrate it into my Surfing Dirt project
(see below)!
